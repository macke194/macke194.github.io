          Float, is a CSS property that allows the left or right alignment of text and similar block elements. Float can act alone, without another property specified, and It is related to text wrapping. The two ideas are similar because, float allows content to move and wrap around the other elements, or photos. This can help create a more table-like design, and maintain organization and structure.

                <img src="Float.jpg" alt="Float" style="width:204px;height:128px;">

          <p>As a property, float can be specified for use in four ways: left, right, none, or inherit. Below is a description of each value, and the specifications for using it with float.</p><p>[Float: none]—No float occurring; any element with a value of none is said to be used in a default position, or shown exactly as it is defined within its context. In other words, no value is attributed for floating to occur; how it is coded is how it will display.</p>
      <p>[Float: right]—Most commonly used. Allows elements and images to be right-aligned.</p>
      <p>[Float: left]— Most commonly used. Allows elements and images to be left-aligned.</p>
      <p>[Float: Inherit}—Pulls the property from a previously specified origin. For example, [Float: inherit], would pull through the float positioning from a parent [div:].</p>
        <p>Issues with formatting layouts using [Float:] may require a variation of this property, and is called [clear:]. This variation of float can be used to work with different browsers, and also multiple layered design layouts. We will discuss [clear:] more in depth in the “Developments” section of this site.</P></p></div>

            [Float:] developed from print media. Newspaper printing stemming from the Industrial Revolution was the earliest start of print media and stylistic design. Journalism spurred paper publishing and font type develop, as early as 1880. It is suggested that the Art Nouveau movement of 1890 would be marked as one of the most influential time when style design and layout organization really developed (“Short History of Print: A blog post” Willborn, S., 2011). </p>
            <p>In 1935,the typewriter was created, and once again changed how we looked at typeface. Design and Layouts continued to evolve and develop how we thought about print and type until 1960, when digital design came about. With Digital design, a positive and negative impact came. Negatively, some would argue digital design would eliminate print media and printing  when the computer came out.Those in Print, would lose their jobs to computers and electronic design; However, what computers did, was revolutionize print by making it more accessible, and easier to replicate information and design. It brought better ways to create designs, and more efficient ways to perfect layouts and text alignment (“Short History of Print: A blog post” Willborn, S., 2011).</p>
            <p>How [Float:] origins really came from this, was the layouts in papers. Newspapers utilized columns, and block text alignment to create headlines and information organization. Different types of newspapers developed, and text size and newspaper formats changed. The new challenge was presenting information in a readable way, that worked with the text and paper size. Thus, formatting became more important (NIOS, “Introduction to Print Media”). One type of paper that did this, was Tabloids. Magazines also show early origins of [Float:] because it incorporated more image and text wrapping than a newspaper would have.
